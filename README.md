# Lasod-Sensetames

Lasod Ecshaega Usmokthrebe Asla, that is, Lasod Sensetames the Fiery Treaty of Healing, was a human born in 239. He is of unknown parentage. Lasod is of divine parentage and possessed unnatural gifts. His legend continues even to this day, in the year 291. His story commenced in the mid-spring of 275, the beginning of his adventures.

Lasod had always been stronger, faster, tougher, and more resilient than others, and he had grown to be quite skilled with a sword. He noticed small details, and that had been one of his great strengths in a fight, for he was unafraid of laying down his blade to pursue an opportune lock. His abilities were not limited to the field of battle, though. His most important strength was not his strength of combat, but his ability to read.

The ability to read is far from commonplace in our world today, and it can bestow great power on a man. The nature of such an ability is strange. It cannot be taught, nor can it be improved upon. It is simply a power some have which others do not.

On that fateful day, Lasod began his journey to greatness. He spoke to his fellow hearthspeople, Thur Baldbodies, and Ino Glazedamuse. Thrilled by the spirit of adventure, they took on the world, seeking glory and death. Far more important is a good death than a good life, and that they knew, but they did not get.

Lasod left the hamlet of his birth for the town of Foldedtwigs. Upon reaching it, he visited the local temple, for he knew a dangerous secret. He had heard rumors of a curse that brought great power, but at a great cost. He scoffed at that cost and saw only the curse's power. He walked by the abandoned pit of the Youthful Church, down to the center of town, to the bustling Abby of Suitors. The abbey was dedicated to Subi Youthflower, the goddess of creation and pregnancy. With one swift push, he brought the curse upon himself, toppling a sacred bronze statue of humans.

A chill ran up his spine. Not an uneasy chill, like one, felt when sensing danger otherwise not performed. Instead, he felt a rush of power, like the blood coursing through his veins held a new power. And it did. Immediately, he saw more in the world. His entire being was twisted together to be perfect for one purpose: sucking blood. His muscles grew stronger and his skin grew tougher. The silhouettes of men outside were visible even through the walls. His eyes were twisted for a sick purpose, and the blood pumping through them was as if it were glowing.

To Thur and Ino, nothing had happened at all. They left without thinking anything of the visit. That only set their fate deeper into the stones it was written on. They left back for Cheerfulcombats, to return to their hamlet to receive a quest. On their way traveling, they ran into a lair west of the hamlet Sanctumlearns. Inside, they found, not a monster, but a dwarf. Lasod spoke up, attempting to ask the dwarf why he was so secluded. Dwarves in The Portentous Universes tend to live in bustling fortresses or booze drunken hillocks. Without even a second thought, the dwarf said: "I hate you."


Lasod's pride got the better of him when spit flew from the dwarf's mouth, only to land on the ground aside from his feet. The true target of that saliva was all but unclear when he saw the look on the dwarf's face. Not holding back with even the slightest inkling of mercy, he charged the dwarf and lopped his head clean off. Without a word, they continued their journey.




Chapter 2




Lasod spoke to the lord of their hamlet and received a quest. They were enlisted to kill Meyi Snarlsavant, the groom of the gloom horror Ustru Shadyghost. Gloom horrors are strange creatures, sparsely covered in long gray feathers, with three short tail stubs. They hide in lairs not too close and not too far from civilization, picking out mortals from nearby hamlets, hillocks, and forest retreats. They transform them into their spouses, to join them in their miserable existence.

As is fitting for the beasts they are, Lasod set off to the lair of the gloom horror's groom in the Languishing Plains with Thur and Ino. They stormed inside and found their formidable opponent. The menacing creature groaned and charged them. Its swift hands moved with dexterity. Wrestling skills are nothing to turn one's nose up at, but a swift hand has no power over the sword if one is skilled in the powers of observation. With caution, Lasod dodged Meyi's attempts to grab at him and slashed and stabbed at his opponent. Blood gushed from the horror, and when it's legs broke, it fell to the ground, where the final blow was given. Lasod stabbed the gloom horror with his copper longsword, tearing the creature's brain. All that was left was a lifeless corpse.

They headed back to the hamlet from which they came, and spread the word of their victory. They did not take on another quest at that moment, but rather, Lasod knew what step further from humanity he would take next. They headed toward the rumored bone-chilling horror, the tower of Wipeearth.




Chapter 3




Deep in the Winter of Spurning lies the tower of Wipeearth. According to legend, it is home to immortals who, drowning in their own knowledge have forgone the needs of mortality. They do not drink, nor eat, nor even sleep. As the intellectuals they are, they remain in their tower day and night leaving only to confirm their own safety. Instead, they have minions that keep mortals from entering and stealing the knowledge they keep to themselves. Minions they have stripped of will and even of life.




Chapter 4




Lasod stepped onto the snowy ground. He knew he was near to his goal, for the tower was finally in view, off in the distance. Thur and Ino were still at his side's, but they were mortals and he was not. They drew closer to the tower, and it became ever more clear to Thur and Ino that something was wrong. It was too late, though. Shambling corpses drew toward them, and Lasod strode on, unaffected by it all. He did not bat an eye nor turn his head or even so much as change his speed of pace as they cried out "Help! Someone save me!" and they were torn limb from limb, blood freezing on contact with the all too cold ground.

Lasod walked on, toward the doors to the tower, out of which had flooded dozens and dozens of zombies. As he reached the bottleneck, he pushed onward through the crowd and he slew the zombies that stood in his way.

There stood a dwarf, indifferent to all that went down. Not even his standing weighed down his legs, for he was no longer mortal.

"You there, dwarf! I am Lasod Sensetames the Fiery Treaty of Healing."

As they spoke, Lasod came to learn of how the dwarf's children had been killed in the year fifty. Not two hundred fifty, but fifty. Yes, this dwarf was one of the first of its kind. He had lived nearly twice a normal lifespan! This came as no surprise to Lasod though. He had known the rumors were true.




He strode up the stairs and came upon the library. Four statues stood in the four corners, but they meant nothing. The real treasure was the monolith that laid on the ground next to one statue. Even that, though, was not what Lasod came for. He dug through the piles of books strewn across the floor, and in that mess he found a book, The Way With Departure. It's pages housed the same secrets that the slab of stone had written in it. He opened its pages and read.




He read until there was nothing left to read, and then he knew. As he learned more and more of the secrets, he became less and less human. Gone was his need to sleep and to eat, to drink and even exhaustion left from his muscles. He felt even more newfound energy fill him.




Chapter 6




He left Wipeearth as if nothing had changed. His companions were gone, ripped to shreds, dead on the ice. He left alone. On his way out, he was ambushed, but he was stronger now than he ever was. A pack of ice wolves had singled him out amongst the desert of snow. His longsword brought the ice wolves down without hesitation. Their bled dry bodies and detached heads rose at his command. He was not alone any longer. He had created new companions, better than his old ones, because he no longer had to hide his secret.




Off he went, to take the world by storm. He did not need to rush, though, for he had all the time in the world.




Twice he was attacked by blizzard men, and once by a sasquatch, but Lasod once again joined with society. He took two companions and asked the locals for rumors. He was not disappointed, for there he heard of a roc. Rocs are great birds, like the majestic eagles of the heavens. However, they are far larger. So large in fact, that they can swoop down from the skies and lift up elephants in their talons. Lasod took his followers on the tough journey up the mountains to the roc's nest.




Chapter 7




Fighting a roc was far more difficult than any opponent had been before, but Lasod was a cautious fighter. He blocked and dodged far more than he used his sword. They approached the roc's nest, but with the newfound tireless legs, Lasod had gained in pace left his companions in the dust as his sprinted over. His ambushing skills were growing better each day, but they were not enough. The bird leaped into the sky, its looming shadow blocking out the sun above them. But there, underneath the beast, were its defenseless legs, which he stabbed and broke the bones of. The ancient bird panicked. It had not been challenged in decades, for all knew of its great strength. Slonu Seasonbeaches was a name worshiped through the world as a god.




This bird was no god, though. Lasod bided his time, blocking the snatches of the bird's talons and the prodding strikes of its beak. Then - he struck the wings of the beast. His new sword lodged deep into its wing. It was strong in flying, and it's wings were msssive, but all it could do was glide down. Lasod swiped his iron longsword and shattered the bones of the bird's other wing, and it came crashing down. Slonu was given no time to recover. Lasod stabbed and stabbed, and crushed the head of the monster.




High on the rush of killing one greater than oneself, Lasod once again left his companions playing catch-up. He visited every lair marked on his map and slew monster after monster. Ayanu Umbrafate, the Cavernous Skull, dusk freak. Chanceomens, the zombie giant lion. Jadegreeds, the zombie giant hyena, and Istrath Glowbranded the Hot Fire. These are the names of those he killed next.




Istrath was by far the strongest opponent Lasod had ever faced. Even Slonu paled in a comparison of power, but as the days went by, Lasod had grown ever stronger and with each enemy defeated, he gained in power. The dragon was nothing more than a trophy to him. He blocked breath after breath of flames, but a sword to the head is something not even a dragon can survive.




Chapter 8




Lasod had lost his companions once again, so he once again decided to join back up with the world. He came upon a bandit camp and told them of his successes. They welcomed him as a lieutenant, but that was not enough for him. He turned on the warlord and killed him, claiming the camp as his own. Kerleb Oilvoiced became another name in a list, instead of a dangerous criminal who terrorized even the hamlets near Lasod's own home. Lasod's crime did not go without being witnessed. Ostri Breachedtunnels mysteriously died that night, found not far from Kerleb's corpse.




This encounter caused much disagreement and the band was dissolved, or rather, eliminated, shortly after. Following that, though, Lasod found another camp, inhabited by goblins. Goblins are rare in this world, The Portentous Universes. The endangered species is said to have only a few dozen members. Most of them live in the razed dark fortresses to the south, which lie in the Winter of Spurning. Mercy for the dying species did not stop Lasod. He slew all of them and claimed the place for himself.




In the time following this, Lasod killed zombie after zombie and took many companions on adventures. He killed the bronze colossus, Kunga Gorgecobra the Yell of Avalanches, and his fame was already growing too great. Not only that, but it was but a short while after that his companions began to notice the secret of Lasod. One night, he asked them to wait outside of a house, but through the door, he left open, they saw something terrible. Something so horrifying that they could not stand by, or even run away. They screamed at him, "Bloodsucker!" and every order of filthy name this world has seen. He sighed, and slew each of them without breaking a sweat. It was a waste, but there was nothing else that could be done.




On that note, Lasod. decided it was time to take a lower profile, and settled into everyday life, living in the hamlet of Thimblewheels. That place was not to his liking, though, so he moved to the hamlet of Whiskedchambers. Months later, he
